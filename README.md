## Permissions Used

The extension requests the following permissions:

*   **`sidePanel`**:
    *   **Reason:** Required to allow the extension to display information in the browser's side panel, providing a persistent view of the exchange rate.
*   **Host Permission for `https://pydolarve.org/`**:
    *   **Reason:** Needed to fetch the exchange rate data from the pydolarve API, which sources its data from the Banco Central de Venezuela.

Additionally, the extension utilizes standard browser capabilities that do not require explicit permission prompts but are essential for its functionality:
*   **`storage` (implicitly used via `chrome.storage.local`)**:
    *   **Reason:** Used to cache the fetched exchange rate data locally. This allows the extension to display data quickly when opened and to show the last known rate even if you are temporarily offline or before the first background update occurs.
*   **`alarms` (implicitly used via `chrome.alarms`)**:
    *   **Reason:** Used to schedule periodic background fetches of the exchange rate data, ensuring the information stays relatively up-to-date without manual intervention.

## Data Source

The exchange rate data is sourced from the **Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV)**. The extension uses the free [pydolarve API](https://pydolarve.org/) to fetch this data.
